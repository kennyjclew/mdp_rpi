	- will tell PC if can move forward (forward_error). await PC response on if need turn/move forward 


PC to
 - tells android arduino's next move (to and)
 - split messages by \n
	- passes entire map string (1 message) to android 
 - rpi (take pic, exploration complete - to turn off camera?) 
 - maintain current coord????

rpi to PC
 - done taking pic/img rec
